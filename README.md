## Introduction

Shiny Apps are server applications written in R. This Project uses Shiny to visualise total and active cases of the Covid-19 disease as well as deaths globally. The app is hosted on [ShinyApps.io](https://pietreus.shinyapps.io/covid19_liveticker/).
By clicking on a country on the map or selecting it via the dropdown menu, a detailed plot for that country, as well as a few stats are displayed. The plots can be modified and saved.

### Used data

This app visualises Covid-19 data from the [COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University](https://pietreus.shinyapps.io/covid19_liveticker/).  
The geographical data for the coloropleth map is the [World Borders Dataset](https://thematicmapping.org/downloads/world_borders.php).
